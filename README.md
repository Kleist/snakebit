Playing around with rust and BBC microbit - trying to build a small game along the way

# TODO - ideas for future development
* Debounce buttons
* Add "snacks" for the snake to eat and grow
* Game over screen
* Press to restart
* Countdown to restart
* Levels (When grown to a size - restart small, but increase speed)
* Animations (e.g. head of snake different intensity, snacks blinking, ...)
* Port to attachable display
